I'm a data researcher working in Chicago. I did my BA and MSc. in Political Science and International Politics respectively, so I've been learning about and thinking about government, policy, and politics for a long time. 

Hopefully I'll bring a comparative perspective from my background in international politics, but my main goal here is to write political critique on topics that I'm not seeing in other places.
