title: I'm up and running!

This is my first post on the site. This is where I'll be putting all my political writing from now on. I'm going to be doing criticism, political commentary, and deeper dives into policy questions that I find interesting. There's no set schedule, so just when I get time to write something I'm happy with.

I encourage anyone who's reading these to write comments and discuss the topics I'm writing about, I'd love the feedback.
